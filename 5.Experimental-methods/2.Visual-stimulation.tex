\section{Visual stimulation}
\label{sec:Visual-stimulation}

For both the ISOI and visual stimuli protocols, an LED display (BenQ XL2411Z, 144-Hz monitor, stimulus presented at $60 Hz$) was used. The screen was placed at $15 cm$ from the mouse's right eye and  aligned at $30ยบ$ to the axis of its nose-line. The stimuli were produced and presented using Matlab and the Psychophysics Toolbox (see \ref{cap:TechnicalImplementations}.
