\textit{Over the experimental process, the appropriate settings of both the animals' state of alertness and of the visual stimulation were chosen as an operative practical balance. In this chapter we describe the methods and specifications of the animals' care and craniotomy cirurgies, as well as the settings of the ISOI and visual stimulation sessions.}
