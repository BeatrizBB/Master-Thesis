\textit{Upon the experimental procedures, a developed pipeline was followed for the analysis of the RF, tuning and SM protocols, for each animal and imaging session. This process will be described hereby, along with the explanation of each utilized tool, analysis scripts and software. In particular, for this project's experiments' analysis, Suit2p software for automated selection of neurons in a raw image and corresponding fluorescence traces extraction was implemented. This package will here be presented and compared with previously used methods.}
