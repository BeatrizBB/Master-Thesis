Thus, creating improved technologies for large-scale recordings of neural activity in the live brain is a crucial goal in neuroscience. Over the past two decades, the combination of optical microscopy and genetically encoded fluorescent indicators has become a widespread means of recording neural activity in nonmammalian and mammalian nervous systems, transforming brain research in the process. In this review, we describe and assess different classes of fluorescent protein indicators of neural activity. We first discuss general considerations in optical imaging and then present salient characteristics of representative indicators.

Using structure-based mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we developed a family of ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors (GCaMP6) that outperformed other sensors in cultured neurons and in zebrafish, flies and mice in vivo. In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5-40-µm long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

The spatial scales of interest to the neurobiologist range from individual synapses (∼1 $\mu$m) to neural circuits (centimeters); the timescales range from the flickering of channels (less than a millisecond) to long-term memory (years). Remarkably, fluorescence microscopy has the potential to revolutionize research on all of these spatial and temporal scales. Two-photon excitation (2PE) laser scanning microscopy allows high-resolution and high-sensitivity fluorescence microscopy in intact neural tissue, which is hostile to traditional forms of microscopy. Over the last 10 years, applications of 2PE, including microscopy and photostimulation, have contributed to our understanding of a broad array of neurobiological phenomena, including the dynamics of single channels in individual synapses and the functional organization of cortical maps. Here we review the principles of 2PE microscopy, highlight recent applications, discuss its limitations, and point to areas for future research and development. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The combination of two-photon microscopy recordings and powerful calcium-dependent fluorescent sensors enables simultaneous recording of unprecedentedly large populations of neurons. While these sensors have matured over several generations of development, computational methods to process their fluorescence remain inefficient and the results hard to interpret. Here, we introduce a set of practical methods based on novel clustering algorithms, and provide a complete pipeline from raw image data to neuronal calcium traces to inferred spike times. We formulate a generative model of the fluorescence image, incorporating spike times and a spatially smooth neuropil signal, and solve the inference and learning problems using a fast algorithm. This implementation scales linearly with the number of recorded cells, and the complete pipeline runs in approximately one hour for typical two-hour long recordings, on commodity GPUs. Furthermore, this method recovers twice as many cells as a previous standard method. This allowed us to routinely record and detect ∼10,000 cells simultaneously from the visual cortex of awake mice using standard two-photon resonant-scanning microscopes. The software is publicly available at github.com/cortex-lab/Suite2P, together with a graphical user interface that allows rapid manual curation of the results.},

SM is the ability of stimuli in the surround of a neuron's receptive field (RF) to modulate (typically suppress) the neuron's response to stimuli simultaneously presented inside the RF, a property thought to underlie optimal coding of sensory information and im-portant perceptual functions. Understanding the circuit and mechanisms for SM can reveal fundamental principles of computations in sensory cortices, from mouse to human. Current debate is centered over whether feedfor-ward or intracortical circuits generate SM, and whether this results from increased inhibition or reduced excitation. Here we present a working hy-pothesis, based on theoretical and experimental evidence, that SM results from feedforward, horizontal, and feedback interactions with local recurrent connections, via synaptic mechanisms involving both increased inhibition and reduced recurrent excitation. In particular, strong and balanced recur-rent excitatory and inhibitory circuits play a crucial role in the computation of SM.},

abstract = {Neuronal responses in primary visual cortex (V1) to optimally oriented high-contrast stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed by stimuli in the RF surround, but can be facilitated when the RF center is stimulated at low contrast. The neural circuits and mechanisms for surround modulation are still unknown. We previously proposed that topdown feedback connections mediate suppression from the “far” surround, while “near” surround suppression is mediated primarily by horizontal connections. We implemented this idea in a recurrent network model of V1. A model assumption needed to account for the contrast-dependent sign of surround modulation is a response asymmetry between excitation and inhibition; accordingly, inhibition, but not excitation, is silent for weak visual inputs to the RF center, and surround stimulation can evoke facilitation. A prediction stemming from this same assumption is that surround suppression is weaker for low than for high contrast stimuli in the RF center. Previous studies are inconsistent with this prediction. Using single unit recordings in macaque V1, we confirm this model's prediction. Model simulations demonstrate that our results can be reconciled with those from previous studies. We also performed a systematic comparison of the experimentally-measured surround suppression strength with predictions of the model operated in different parameter regimes. We find that the original model, with strong horizontal and no feedback excitation of local inhibitory neurons, can only partially account quantitatively for the experimentally-measured suppression. Strong direct feedback excitation of V1 inhibitory neurons is necessary to account for the experimentally-measured surround suppression strength.},

abstract = {The responses ofneurons in sensory cortices are affected by the spatial context within which stimuli are embedded. In the primary visual cortex (V1), orientation-selective responses to stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed bysimilarly oriented stimuli in the RF surround. Surround suppression, a likely neural correlate of perceptual figure–ground segregation, is traditionally thought to be generated within V1 by long-range horizontal connections. Recently however, it has been shown that these connections are too short and too slow to mediate fast suppression from distant regions ofthe RF surround. We use an anatomically and physiologically constrained recurrent networkmodel ofmacaqueV1 to showhow interareal feedback connections, which are faster and longer-range than horizontal connections, can generate “far” surround suppression. We provide a novel solution to the puzzle ofhow surround suppression can arise from excitatory feedback axons contacting predominantly excitatory neurons in V1. The basic mechanism involves divergent feedback connections from the far surround targeting pyramidal neurons sending monosynaptic horizontal connections to excitatory and inhib- itory neurons in the RF center. One ofseveral predictions ofour model is that the “suppressive far surround” is not always suppressive, but can facilitate the response ofthe RF center, depending on the amount ofexcitatory drive to the local inhibitors. Our model provides a general mechanism of how top-down feedback signals directly contribute to generating cortical neuron responses to simple sensory stimuli.},

abstract = {In macaque primary visual cortex (V1) neuronal responses to stimuli inside the receptive field (RF) are modulated by stimuli in the RF surround. This modulation is orientation-specific. Previous studies suggested that for some cells this specificity may not be fixed, but changes with the stimulus orientation presented to the RF. We demonstrate, in recording studies, that this tuning behavior is instead highly prevalent in V1 and, in theoretical work, that it arises only if V1 operates in a regime of strong local recurrence. Strongest surround suppression occurs when the stimuli in the RF and the surround are iso-oriented, and strongest facilitation when the stimuli are cross-oriented. This is the case even when the RF is sub-optimally activated by a stimulus of non- preferred orientation, but only if this stimulus can activate the cell when presented alone. This tuning behavior emerges from the interaction of lateral inhibition (via the surround pathways), which is tuned to the RF's preferred orientation, with weakly-tuned, but strong, local recurrent connections, causing maximal withdrawal of recurrent excitation at the feedforward input orientation. Thus, horizontal and feedback modulation of strong recurrent circuits allows the tuning of contextual effects to change with changing feedforward inputs.},

abstract = {The responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) to stimulation of their receptive field (RF) are modulated by stimuli in the RF surround. This modulation is suppressive when the stimuli in the RF and surround are of similar orientation, but less suppressive or facilitatory when they are cross-oriented. Similarly, in human vision surround stimuli selectively suppress the perceived contrast of a central stimulus. Although the properties of surround modulation have been thoroughly characterized in many species, cortical areas and sensory modalities, its role in perception remains unknown. Here we argue that surround modulation in V1 consists of multiple components having different spatio-temporal and tuning properties, generated by different neural circuits and serving different visual functions. One component arises from LGN afferents, is fast, untuned for orientation, and spatially restricted to the surround region nearest to the RF (the near-surround); its function is to normalize V1 cell responses to local contrast. Intra-V1 horizontal connections contribute a slower, narrowly orientation-tuned component to near-surround modulation, whose function is to increase the coding efficiency of natural images in manner that leads to the extraction of object boundaries. The third component is generated by topdown feedback connections to V1, is fast, broadly orientation-tuned, and extends into the far-surround; its function is to enhance the salience of behaviorally relevant visual features. Far- and near-surround modulation, thus, act as parallel mechanisms: the former quickly detects and guides saccades/attention to salient visual scene locations, the latter segments object boundaries in the scene.},

One can map a relatively large region, obtain successive maps to different stimuli in the same cortical area and follow variations in response over time. In the intact mammalian brain this imaging has been accomplished with the aid of voltage sensitive dyes. However, it has been known for many years that some intrinsic changes in the optical properties of the tissue are dependent on electrical or metabolic activity. Here we show that these changes can be used to study the functional architecture of cortex. Optical maps of whisker barrels in the rat and the orientation columns in the cat visual cortex, obtained by reflection measurements of the intrinsic signal, were confirmed with voltage sensitive dyes or by electrophysiological recordings. In addition, we describe an intrinsic signal originating from small arteries which can be used to investigate the communication between local neuronal activity and the microvasculature. One advantage of the method is that it is non-invasive and does not require dyes, a clear benefit for clinical applications.},

abstract = {In primary visual cortex (V1) neuronal responses to stimuli inside the receptive field (RF) are usually suppressed by stimuli in the RF surround. This suppression is orientation-specific. Similarly, in human vision surround stimuli can suppress perceived contrast of a central stimulus in an orientation-dependent manner. The surround consists of two regions likely generated by different circuits: a near-surround generated predominantly by geniculocortical and intra-V1 horizontal connections, and a far-surround generated exclusively by inter-areal feedback. Using stimuli confined to the near- or far-surround of V1 neurons, and similar stimuli in human psychophysics, we find that near-surround suppression is more sharply orientation-tuned than far- surround suppression in both macaque V1 and human perception. These results point to a similarity between surround suppression in macaque V1 and human vision, and suggest that feedback circuits are less orientation-biased than horizontal circuits. We find sharpest tuning of near-surround suppression in V1 layers (3, 4B, 4C$\alpha$) with patterned and orientation-specific horizontal connections. Sharpest tuning of far-surround suppression occurs in layer 4B, suggesting greater orientation-specificity of feedback to this layer. Different orientation-tuning of near and far surround suppression may reflect a statistical bias in natural images, whereby nearby edges have higher probability than distant edges of being co-oriented and belonging to the same contour. Surround suppression would, thus, increase the coding efficiency of frequently co-occurring contours and the saliency of less frequent ones. Such saliency increase can help detect small orientation differences in nearby edges (for contour completion), but large orientation differences in distant edges (for directing saccades/attention).},

abstract = {Hemodynamic-based brain imaging techniques are typically incapable of monitoring brain activity with both high spatial and high temporal resolutions. In this study, we have used intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI), a relatively high spatial resolution imaging technique, to examine the temporal resolution of the hemodynamic signal. We imaged V1 responses in anesthetized monkey to a moving light spot. Movies of cortical responses clearly revealed a focus of hemodynamic response traveling across the cortical surface. Importantly, at different locations along the cortical trajectory, response timecourses maintained a similar tri-phasic shape and shifted sequentially across cortex with a predictable delay. We calculated the time between distinguishable timecourses and found that the temporal resolution of the signal at which two events can be reliably distinguished is about 80 milliseconds. These results suggest that hemodynamic-based imaging is suitable for detecting ongoing cortical events at high spatial resolution and with temporal resolution relevant for behavioral studies.},

abstract = {The responsiveness of neurons in V1 is modulated by stimuli placed outside their classical receptive fields. This nonclassical surround provides input from a larger portion of the visual scene than originally thought, permitting integration of information at early levels in the visual processing stream. Signals from the surround have been reported variously to be suppressive and facilitatory, selective and unselective. We tested the specificity of influences from the surround by studying the interactions between drifting sinusoidal gratings carefully confined to conservatively defined center and surround regions. We found that the surround influence was always suppressive when the surround grating was at the neuron's preferred orientation. Suppression tended to be stronger when the surround grating also moved in the neuron's preferred direction, rather than its opposite. When the orientation in the surround was 90 degrees from the preferred orientation (orthogonal), suppression was weaker, and facilitation was sometimes evident. The tuning of surround signals therefore tended to match the tuning of the center, though the tuning of the surround was somewhat broader. The tuning of suppression also depended on the contrast of the center grating-when the center grating was reduced in contrast, orthogonal surround stimuli became relatively more suppressive. We also found evidence for the tuning of the surround being dependent to some degree on the stimulus used in the center-suppression was often stronger for a given center stimulus when the parameters of the surround grating matched the parameters of the center grating even when the center grating was not itself of the optimal direction or orientation. We also explored the spatial distribution of surround influence and found an orderly relationship between the orientation of grating patches presented to regions of the surround and the position of greatest suppression. When surround gratings were oriented parallel to the preferred orientation of the receptive field, suppression was strongest at the receptive field ends. When surround gratings were orthogonal, suppression was strongest on the flanks. We conclude that the surround has complex effects on responses from the classical receptive field. We suggest that the underlying mechanism of this complexity may involve interactions between relatively simple center and surround mechanisms.},

abstract = {In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit re- sponses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh {\&} Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving light- adapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli with receptive field arrangements. Some cells could be activated from either eye, and in these binocular interaction was studied.},

abstract = {The responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) to stimulation of their receptive field (RF) are modulated by stimuli in the RF surround. This modulation is suppressive when the stimuli in the RF and surround are of similar orientation, but less suppressive or facilitatory when they are cross-oriented. Similarly, in human vision surround stimuli selectively suppress the perceived contrast of a central stimulus. Although the properties of surround modulation have been thoroughly characterized in many species, cortical areas and sensory modalities, its role in perception remains unknown. Here we argue that surround modulation in V1 consists of multiple components having different spatio-temporal and tuning properties, generated by different neural circuits and serving different visual functions. One component arises from LGN afferents, is fast, untuned for orientation, and spatially restricted to the surround region nearest to the RF (the near-surround); its function is to normalize V1 cell responses to local contrast. Intra-V1 horizontal connections contribute a slower, narrowly orientation-tuned component to near-surround modulation, whose function is to increase the coding efficiency of natural images in manner that leads to the extraction of object boundaries. The third component is generated by topdown feedback connections to V1, is fast, broadly orientation-tuned, and extends into the far-surround; its function is to enhance the salience of behaviorally relevant visual features. Far- and near-surround modulation, thus, act as parallel mechanisms: the former quickly detects and guides saccades/attention to salient visual scene locations, the latter segments object boundaries in the scene.},

abstract = {Information is integrated across the visual field to transform local features into a global percept. We now know that V1 neurons provide more spatial integration than originally thought due to the existence of their nonclassical inhibitory surrounds. To understand spatial integration in the visual cortex, we have studied the nature and extent of center and surround influences on neuronal response. We used drifting sinusoidal gratings in circular and annular apertures to estimate the sizes of the receptive field's excitatory center and suppressive surround. We used combinations of stimuli inside and outside the receptive field to explore the nature of the surround influence on the receptive field center as a function of the relative and absolute contrast of stimuli in the two regions. We conclude that the interaction is best explained as a divisive modulation of response gain by signals from the surround. We then develop a receptive field model based on the ratio of signals from Gaussian-shaped center and surround mechanisms. We show that this model can account well for the variations in receptive field size with contrast that we and others have observed and for variations in size with the state of contrast adaptation. The model achieves this success by simple variations in the relative gain of the two component mechanisms of the receptive field. This model thus offers a parsimonious explanation of a variety of phenomena involving changes in apparent receptive field size and accounts for these phenomena purely in terms of two receptive field mechanisms that do not themselves change in size. We used the extent of the center mechanism in our model as an indicator of the spatial extent of the central excitatory portion of the receptive field. We compared the extent of the center to measurements of horizontal connections within V1 and determined that horizontal intracortical connections are well matched in extent to the receptive field center mechanism. Input to the suppressive surround may come in part from feedback signals from higher areas.},

abstract = {The true receptive field of more than 90{\%} of neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) extends well beyond the classical receptive field (crf), as mapped with conventional bar or spot stimuli, and includes a surrounding region that is 50 to 100 times the area of the crf. These extensive surrounds are demonstrated by simultaneously stimulating the crf and the surround with moving stimuli. The surrounds commonly have directional and velocity-selective influences that are antagonis­ tic to the response from the crf. The crfs of MT neurons are organized in a topographic representation of the visual field{\_} Thus MT neurons are embedded in an orderly visuotopic array, but are capable of integrating local stimulus conditions within a global context. The extensive surrounds of MT neurons may be involved in figure-ground discrimination, preattentive vision, perceptual constancies, and depth perception through motion cues. I Introduction We perceive the visual world as an unitary whole, yet one of the guiding principles of more than four decades of neurophysiological research on the visual system has been that neurons respond to stimulation within their classical receptive fields (crfs), which are '­ usually discrete small portions of the total visual field (Hartline 1938). The crfs are organized into a series of topographic representations of the visual field. At least ten areas, each containing a separate map of the visual field, are present in the visual cortex in the owl monkey (see figure 1). It has been widely assumed that perceptual functions that require the integration of inputs over large portions of visual space must be either collective properties of arrays of neurons representing the visual field or else be features of those neurons at the highest processing levels in the visual system, such as those neurons in inferotemporal or posterior parietal cortex that typically possess very large receptive fields and do not appear to be organized in visuotopic maps. These assump­ tions have been based on results of studies in which receptive fields were mapped with conventional stimuli, spots or bars of light, presented on a featureless background. However, unlike the neurophysiologist's tangent screen, the natural visual scene is rich in features (see figure 2), We thought it would be especially appropriate to study the effects of background motion since the visual field is filled with moving stimuli as the viewer moves through or scans its environment. Neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) are specialized for the analysis of moving stimuli, and possess well defined crfs that are organized in a topographic representation of the visual field (Allman and Kaas ..},

abstract = {From the analyses of our own and others' anatomical and physiological data for the macaque visual system, we arrive at a conclusion that three pathways can provide the V1 neuron with access to information from the visual field and affect its response. First, direct thalamic input can determine the size of the initial activating RF at high contrast. Second, lateral connections can enlarge the RF at low contrast by pooling information from larger regions of cortex that are otherwise ineffective when high contrast thalamic input is driving the cortical neuron. Thirdly, feedback from extrastriate cortex (possibly together with overlap or interdigitation of coactive lateral connectional fields within VI) can provide a large and stimulus specific surround modulatory field. The stimulus specificity of the interactions between the center and surround fields, may be due to the orderly, matching structure and different scales of intra-areal and feedback projection excitatory pathways. The observed activity changes of single recorded excitatory neurons could be a result of the relative weight of excitation on the excitatory neurons themselves and on local inhibitory interneurons that synapse on them. Inhibitory basket neurons, driven by the local excitatory neurons, could govern local interactions between cortical patches of different tuning properties, resulting in more distant changes in excitatory input in the laterally connected intra-areal neuronal pools.},

abstract = {A central question in visual neuroscience is what circuits generate the responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). V1 neurons respond best to oriented stimuli of optimal size within their receptive field (RF) center. This size tuning is contrast dependent, i.e. a neuron's optimal stimulus size measured at high contrast (the high-contrast summation RF, or hsRF) is smaller than when measured using low-contrast stimuli (the low-contrast summation RF, or lsRF). Responses to stimuli in the RF center are usually suppressed by iso-oriented stimuli in the extra-classical RF surround. Iso-orientation surround suppression is fast and long range, extending well beyond the size of V1 cells' lsRF. Geniculocortical feedforward (FF), V1 lateral and extrastriate feedback (FB) connections to V1 could all contribute to generating the RF center and surround of V1 neurons. Studies on the spatio-temporal properties and functional organization of these connections can help disclose their specific contributions to the responses of V1 cells. These studies, reviewed in this chapter, have shown that FF afferents to V1 integrate signals within the hsRF of V1 cells; V1 lateral connections are commensurate with the size of the lsRF and may, thus, underlie contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation, and modulatory effects arising from the surround region closer to the RF center (the "near" surround). The spatial and temporal properties of lateral connections cannot account for the dimensions and onset latency of modulation arising from more distant regions of the surround (the "far" surround). Inter-areal FB connections to V1, instead, are commensurate with the full spatial range of center and surround responses, and show fast conduction velocity consistent with the short onset latency of modulation arising from the "far" surround. We review data showing that a subset of FB connections terminate in a patchy fashion in V1, and show modular and orientation specificity, consistent with their proposed role in orientation-specific center-surround interactions. We propose specific mechanisms by which each connection type contributes to the RF center and surround of V1 neurons, and implement these hypotheses into a recurrent network model. We show physiological data in support of the model's predictions, revealing that modulation from the "far" surround is not always suppressive, but can be facilitatory under specific stimulus conditions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Iso-orientation surround suppression is a powerful form of visual contextual modulation in which a stimulus of the preferred orientation of a neuron placed outside the classical receptive field (CRF) of the neuron suppresses the response to stimuli within the CRF. This suppression is most often attributed to orientation-tuned signals that propagate laterally across the cortex, activating local inhibition. By studying the temporal properties of surround suppression, we have uncovered characteristics that challenge standard notions of surround suppression. We found that the latency of suppression depended on its strength. Across cells, strong suppression arrived on average 30 msec earlier than weak suppression, and suppression sometimes arrived faster than the excitatory CRF response. We compared the relative latency of CRF response onset and offset with the relative latency of suppression onset and offset. Response onset was delayed relative to response offset in the CRF but not in the surround. This is not the expected result if neurons targeted by suppression are like those that generate it. We examined the time course of suppression as a function of distance of the surround stimulus from the CRF and found that suppression was predominantly sustained for nearby stimuli and predominantly transient for distant stimuli. By comparing the latency of suppression for nearby and distant stimuli, we found that orientation-tuned suppression could effectively propagate across 6 - 8 mm of cortex at approximately 1 m/sec. This is considerably faster than expected for horizontal cortical connections previously implicated in surround suppression. We offer refinements to circuits for surround suppression that account for these results and describe how feedback from cells with large CRFs can account for the rapid propagation of suppression within V1.},

We compared the results with the RF center-surround organization of V1 and V2 neurons in macaque monkeys. If species differences in spatial scale are taken into consideration, mouse V1 and V2L neurons had remarkably fine stimulus selectivity, and the majority of response properties in V2L were not different from those in V1. The RF center-surround organization of mouse V1 neurons was qualitatively similar to that for macaque monkeys (i.e., the RF center is surrounded by extended suppressive regions). However, unlike in monkey V2, a significant proportion of cortical neurons, largely complex cells in V2L, did not exhibit quantifiable RF surround suppression. Simple cells had smaller RF centers than complex cells, and the prevalence and strength of surround suppression were greater in simple cells than in complex cells. These findings, particularly on the RF center-surround organization of visual cortical neurons, give new insights into the principles governing cortical circuits in the mouse visual cortex and should provide further impetus for the use of mice in studies on the genetic and molecular basis of RF development and synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural computations, repeating them across brain regions and modalities to apply similar operations to different problems. A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

abstract = {Information is integrated across the visual field to transform local features into a global percept. We now know that V1 neurons provide more spatial integration than originally thought due to the existence of their nonclassical inhibitory surrounds. To understand spatial integration in the visual cortex, we have studied the nature and extent of center and surround influences on neuronal response. We used drifting sinusoidal gratings in circular and annular apertures to estimate the sizes of the receptive field's excitatory center and suppressive surround. We used combinations of stimuli inside and outside the receptive field to explore the nature of the surround influence on the receptive field center as a function of the relative and absolute contrast of stimuli in the two regions. We conclude that the interaction is best explained as a divisive modulation of response gain by signals from the surround. We then develop a receptive field model based on the ratio of signals from Gaussian-shaped center and surround mechanisms. We show that this model can account well for the variations in receptive field size with contrast that we and others have observed and for variations in size with the state of contrast adaptation. The model achieves this success by simple variations in the relative gain of the two component mechanisms of the receptive field. This model thus offers a parsimonious explanation of a variety of phenomena involving changes in apparent receptive field size and accounts for these phenomena purely in terms of two receptive field mechanisms that do not themselves change in size. We used the extent of the center mechanism in our model as an indicator of the spatial extent of the central excitatory portion of the receptive field. We compared the extent of the center to measurements of horizontal connections within V1 and determined that horizontal intracortical connections are well matched in extent to the receptive field center mechanism. Input to the suppressive surround may come in part from feedback signals from higher areas.},

abstract = {We used a dual-masking paradigm to study how contrast discrimination is influenced by the presence of adjacent stimuli differing in orientation. The task of the observer was to detect a vertical Gabor target superimposed on a vertical Gabor pedestal in the presence of flankers. The Gabor flankers had orientations ranging from 0 degrees (parallel to the target) to 90 degrees (orthogonal). The flankers had two different facilitatory effects: (a) Threshold facilitation. The flankers facilitated target detection at low pedestal contrasts. This facilitation was narrowly tuned to flanker orientation. (b) Pedestal enhancement. The flankers at high contrast enhanced the masking effectiveness of the pedestal. This pedestal enhancement changed little with flanker orientation. We fitted the data with a sensitivity modulation model in which the flanker effects were implemented as multiplicative factors modulating the sensitivity of the target mechanism to both excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The model parameters showed that, (a) pedestal enhancement occurs when flanker facilitation to the pedestal is greater than to the target; (b) while the sensitivity modulation was tuned sharply with flanker orientation, the ratio between the excitatory and the inhibitory factors remained constant. The explanation of the flanker orientation effect requires the both the values of each factor and the ratio between them.},

When the texture patch is surrounded by high-contrast texture, the bright points of the texture patch appear dimmer, and simul- taneously, its dark points appear less dark than when it is surrounded by a uniform background. The induced reduction of apparent contrast is greatly diminished when (i) the texture patch and background are filtered into nonoverlapping spatial frequency bands or (i) the texture patch and background are presented to different eyes.

abstract = {1. The classically defined receptive field of a visual neuron is the area of visual space over which the cell responds to visual stimuli. It is well established, however, that the discharge produced by an optimal stimulus can be modulated by the presence of additional stimuli that by themselves do not produce any response. This study examines inhibitory influences that originate from areas located outside of the classical (i.e., excitatory) receptive field. Previous work has shown that for some cells the response to a properly oriented bar of light becomes attenuated when the bar extends beyond the receptive field, a phenomenon known as end-inhibition (or length tuning). Analogously, it has been shown that increasing the number of cycles of a drifting grating stimulus may also inhibit the firing of some cells, an effect known as side-inhibition (or width tuning). Very little information is available, however, about the relationship between end- and side-inhibition. We have examined the spatial organization and tuning characteristics of these inhibitory effects by recording extracellularly from single neurons in the cat's striate cortex (Area 17). 2. For each cortical neuron, length and width tuning curves were obtained with the use of rectangular patches of drifting sinusoidal gratings that have variable length and width. Results from 82 cells show that the strengths of end- and side-inhibition tend to be correlated. Most cells that exhibit clear end-inhibition also show a similar degree of side-inhibition. For these cells, the excitatory receptive field is surrounded on all sides by inhibitory zones. Some cells exhibit only end- or side-inhibition, but not both. Data for 28 binocular cells show that length and width tuning curves for the dominant and nondominant eyes tend to be closely matched. 3. We also measured tuning characteristics of end- and side-inhibition. To obtain these data, the excitatory receptive field was stimulated with a grating patch having optimal orientation, spatial frequency, and size, whereas the end- or side-inhibitory regions were stimulated with patches of gratings that had a variable parameter (such as orientation). Results show that end- and side-inhibition tend to be strongest at the orientation and spatial frequency that yield maximal excitation. However, orientation and spatial frequency tuning curves for inhibition are considerably broader than those for excitation, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by a pool of neurons.},

abstract = {The representation of the visual field in the middle temporal area (MT) was examined by recording from single neurons in anesthetized, immobilized macaques. Measurements of receptive field size, variability of receptive field position (scatter) and magnification factor were obtained within the representation of the central 25 degree. Over at least short distances (less than 3 mm), the visual field representation in MT is surprisingly orderly. Receptive field size increases as a linear function of eccentricity and is about ten times larger than in V1 at all eccentricities. Scatter in receptive field position at any point in the visual field representation is equal to about one-third of the receptive field size at that location, the same relationship that has been found in V1. Magnification factor in MT is only about one-fifth that reported in V1 within the central 5 degree but appears to decline somewhat less steeply than in V1 with increasing eccentricity. Because the smaller magnification factor in MT relative to V1 is complemented by larger receptive field size and scatter, the point-image size (the diameter of the region of cortex activated by a single point in the visual field) is roughly comparable in the two areas. On the basis of these results, as well as on our previous finding that 180 degrees of axis of stimulus motion in MT are represented in about the same amount of tissue as 180 degrees of stimulus orientation in V1, we suggest that a stimulus at one point in the visual field activates at least as many functional "modules" in MT as in V1.},

abstract = {1. Cells in area 17 of the cat visual cortex were studied with a view towards correlating receptive field properties with layering. A number of receptive field parameters were measured for all units, and nearly every unit was marked with a microlesion to determine accurately the layer in which it was found.2. Cells were defined as simple or complex by mapping with stationary stimuli, using the criteria of Hubel {\&} Wiesel (1962). Complex cells fell into two groups: those that showed summation for increased slit length (standard complex) and those that did not (special complex).3. The simple cells were located in the deep part of layer 3, in layer 4, and in layer 6. This corresponds to the distribution of afferents from the dorsal layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. In these cortical layers the simple cells differed primarily with respect to their receptive field size, cells in layer 4 having the smallest, layer 3 intermediate, and layer 6 the largest fields. Layer 4 was the only layer in which simple cells showed end-inhibition (a reduction in response to slits extending beyond the excitatory portion of the receptive field).4. The standard complex cells were found in all layers, but were quite scarce in layer 4. As with the simple cells, field size varied with layer: in layer 2+3 they had small to intermediate field sizes, in layer 5 intermediate, and in layer 6 very large. Layer 6 cells showed summation for slits of increased length up to very large values, and responded best when the slits were centred in the receptive field. The only standard complex cells that showed end-inhibition were those in layer 2+3, and these were similar to the layer 4 simple cells in terms of proportion of end-inhibited units and degree of end-inhibition.5. The special complex cells, originally described by Palmer {\&} Rosenquist (1974), were found in two tiers: the upper one at the layer 3/layer 4 border and the lower one in layer 5. They were different from the standard complex cells in having a high spontaneous activity, high velocity preference, and large fields which were similar in size (at a given eccentricity) from one cell to the next. Many showed reduced response to slits of increasing length, even for slits that did not extend beyond the borders of the responsive region.6. Cells in layer 6 (the origin of the corticogeniculate projection) were antidromically activated from the lateral geniculate nucleus. The antidromically activated units included both simple and complex cells, and they had the long receptive fields characteristic of the overall population of cells in layer 6.7. The results showed that there are different types of simple and complex cells, and that cells in different layers have different properties. Taken together with their differences in site of projection, this demonstrates that the anatomical lamination pattern is reflected in functional differences between cells in different layers.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex, V1, very often have extraclassical receptive fields (eCRFs). The eCRF is defined as the region of visual space where stimuli cannot elicit a spiking response but can modulate the response of a stimulus in the classical receptive field (CRF). We investigated the dependence of the eCRF on stimulus contrast and orientation in macaque V1 cells for which the laminar location was determined. The eCRF was more sensitive to contrast than the CRF across the whole population of V1 cells with the greatest contrast differential in layer 2/3. We confirmed that many V1 cells experience stronger suppression for collinear than orthogonal stimuli in the eCRF. Laminar analysis revealed that the predominant bias for collinear suppression was found in layers 2/3 and 4b. The laminar pattern of contrast and orientation dependence suggests that eCRF suppression may derive from different neural circuits in different layers, and may be comprised of two distinct components: orientation-tuned and untuned suppression. On average tuned suppression was delayed by ∼25 ms compared with the onset of untuned suppression. Therefore, response modulation by the eCRF develops dynamically and rapidly in time.},

@article{Ichida2007,
abstract = {In primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses to optimally oriented stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are usually suppressed by iso-oriented stimuli in the RF surround. The mechanisms and pathways giving rise to surround modulation, a possible neural correlate of perceptual figure-ground segregation, are not yet identified. We previously proposed that highly divergent and fast-conducting top-down feedback connections are the substrate for fast modulation arising from the more distant regions of the surround. We have recently implemented this idea into a recurrent network model (Schwabe et al. 2006). The purpose of this study was to test a crucial prediction of this feedback model, namely that the suppressive "far" surround of V1 neurons can be facilitatory under conditions that weakly activate neurons in the RF center. Using single-unit recordings in macaque V1, we found iso-orientation far-surround facilitation when the RF center was driven by a low-contrast stimulus and the far surround by a small annular stimulus. Suppression occurred when the center stimulus contrast or the size of the surround stimulus was increased. This suggests that center-surround interactions result from excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms of similar spatial extent, and that changes in the balance of local excitation and inhibition, induced by surround stimulation, determine whether facilitation or suppression occurs. In layer 4C, the main target of geniculocortical afferents, lacking long-range intra-cortical connections, far-surround facilitation was rare and large surround fields were absent. This strongly suggests that feedforward connections do not contribute to far-surround modulation and that the latter is generated by intra-cortical mechanisms, likely involving top-down feedback.},

The animals were trained to identify the figure patches by making saccadic eye movements towards their positions. Almost every cell gave a significantly larger response to elements belonging to the figure than to similar elements belonging to the background. The figure-ground response enhancement was present along the entire extent of the patch and was absent as soon as the receptive field was outside the patch. The strength of the effect had no relation with classical receptive field properties like orientation or direction selectivity or receptive field size. The response enhancement had a latency of 30-40 msec relative to the onset of the neuronal response itself.

abstract = {The initial image-processing stages of visual cortex are well suited to a local (patchwise) analysis of the viewed scene. But the world's structures extend over space as textures and surfaces, suggesting the need for spatial integration. Most models of contrast vision fall shy of this process because (i) the weak area summation at detection threshold is attributed to probability summation (PS) and (ii) there is little or no advantage of area well above threshold. Both of these views are challenged here. First, it is shown that results at threshold are consistent with linear summation of contrast following retinal inhomogeneity, spatial filtering, nonlinear contrast transduction and multiple sources of additive Gaussian noise. We suggest that the suprathreshold loss of the area advantage in previous studies is due to a concomitant increase in suppression from the pedestal. To overcome this confound, a novel stimulus class is designed where: (i) the observer operates on a constant retinal area, (ii) the target area is controlled within this summation field, and (iii) the pedestal is fixed in size. Using this arrangement, substantial summation is found along the entire masking function, including the region of facilitation. Our analysis shows that PS and uncertainty cannot account for the results, and that suprathreshold summation of contrast extends over at least seven target cycles of grating.},

abstract = {Test targets ('singletons') that displayed orientation, motion, luminance, or color contrast, or pairwise combinations of these, were presented in line texture arrays, and their saliences were quantified in comparison to reference targets at defined luminance levels. In general, saliency effects in different stimulus dimensions did add, but did not add linearly. That is, targets with feature contrast in two dimensions were generally more salient than targets with only one of these properties, but often less salient than predicted from the sum of the individual saliency components. Salience variations within a dimension were compared with and without a second saliency effect added. The resulting gain reduction in the combined stimulus conditions was interpreted to reflect the amount of overlap between the respective saliency mechanisms. Combinations of orientation and color contrast produced the strongest gain reduction (about 90{\%} for color in orientation) thus indicating the strongest overlap of underlying saliency mechanisms. Combinations of orientation and motion contrast revealed about 50{\%} overlap, slightly smaller rates were found for combinations of color and motion. All combinations with luminance contrast (orientation and luminance, motion and luminance) produced only little gain reduction ({\textless}30{\%}) thus indicating a higher degree of independence between the underlying saliency mechanisms than for other stimulus dimensions.

abstract = {Contextual modulation is a fundamental feature of sensory processing, both on perceptual and on single-neuron level. When the diameter of a visual stimulus is increased, the firing rate of a cell typically first increases (summation field) and then decreases (surround field). Such an area summation function draws a comprehensive profile of the receptive field structure of a neuron, including areas outside the classical receptive field. We investigated area summation in human vision with psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The stimuli were drifting sine wave gratings similar to those used in previous macaque single-cell area summation studies [corrected]. A model was developed to facilitate comparison of area summation in fMRI to area summation in psychophysics and single cells. The model consisted of units with an antagonistic receptive field structure found in single cells in the primary visual cortex. The receptive field centers of the model neurons were distributed in the region of the visual field covered by a single voxel. The measured area summation functions were qualitatively similar to earlier single-cell data. The model with parameters derived from psychophysics captured the spatial structure of the summation field in the primary visual cortex as measured with fMRI. The model also generalized to a novel situation in which the neural population was displaced from the stimulus center. The current study shows that contextual modulation arises from similar spatially antagonistic and overlapping excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms, both in single cells and in human vision.},

abstract = {The responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) to stimulation of their receptive field (RF) are modulated by stimuli in the RF surround. This modulation is suppressive when the stimuli in the RF and surround are of similar orientation, but less suppressive or facilitatory when they are cross-oriented. Similarly, in human vision surround stimuli selectively suppress the perceived contrast of a central stimulus. Although the properties of surround modulation have been thoroughly characterized in many species, cortical areas and sensory modalities, its role in perception remains unknown. Here we argue that surround modulation in V1 consists of multiple components having different spatio-temporal and tuning properties, generated by different neural circuits and serving different visual functions. One component arises from LGN afferents, is fast, untuned for orientation, and spatially restricted to the surround region nearest to the RF (the near-surround); its function is to normalize V1 cell responses to local contrast. Intra-V1 horizontal connections contribute a slower, narrowly orientation-tuned component to near-surround modulation, whose function is to increase the coding efficiency of natural images in manner that leads to the extraction of object boundaries. The third component is generated by topdown feedback connections to V1, is fast, broadly orientation-tuned, and extends into the far-surround; its function is to enhance the salience of behaviorally relevant visual features. Far- and near-surround modulation, thus, act as parallel mechanisms: the former quickly detects and guides saccades/attention to salient visual scene locations, the latter segments object boundaries in the scene.},

abstract = {The firing rates of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are suppressed by large stimuli, an effect known as surround suppression. In cats and monkeys, the strength of suppression is sensitive to orientation; responses to regions containing uniform orientations are more suppressed than those containing orientation contrast. This effect is thought to be important for scene segmentation, but the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. We asked whether it is possible to study these mechanisms in the visual cortex of mice, because of recent advances in technology for studying the cortical circuitry in mice. It is unknown whether neurons in mouse V1 are sensitive to orientation contrast. We measured the orientation selectivity of surround suppression in the different layers of mouse V1. We found strong surround suppression in layer 4 and the superficial layers, part of which was orientation tuned: iso-oriented surrounds caused more suppression than cross-oriented surrounds. Surround suppression was delayed relative to the visual response and orientation-tuned suppression was delayed further, suggesting two separate suppressive mechanisms. Previous studies proposed that surround suppression depends on the activity of inhibitory somatostatin-positive interneurons in the superficial layers. To test the involvement of the superficial layers we topically applied lidocaine. Silencing of the superficial layers did not prevent orientation-tuned suppression in layer 4. These results show that neurons in mouse V1, which lacks orientation columns, show orientation-dependent surround suppression in layer 4 and the superficial layers and that surround suppression in layer 4 does not require contributions from neurons in the superficial layers.},

Previous studies suggested that, for some cells, this specificity may not be fixed but changes with the stimulus orientation presented to the RF. We demonstrate, in recording studies, that this tuning behavior is instead highly prevalent in V1 and, in theoretical work, that it arises only if V1 operates in a regime of strong local recurrence. Strongest surround suppression occurs when the stimuli in the RF and the surround are iso-oriented, and strongest facilitation when the stimuli are cross-oriented. This is the case even when the RF is suboptimally activated by a stimulus of nonpreferred orientation but only if this stimulus can activate the cell when presented alone. This tuning behavior emerges from the interaction of lateral inhibition (via the surround pathways), which is tuned to the preferred orientation of the RF, with weakly tuned, but strong, local recurrent connections, causing maximal withdrawal of recurrent excitation at the feedforward input orientation. Thus, horizontal and feedback modulation of strong recurrent circuits allows the tuning of contextual effects to change with changing feedforward inputs.},

abstract = {In primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses to stimuli inside the receptive field (RF) are usually suppressed by stimuli in the RF surround. This suppression is orientation specific. Similarly, in human vision surround stimuli can suppress perceived contrast of a central stimulus in an orientation-dependent manner. The surround consists of two regions likely generated by different circuits: a near-surround generated predominantly by geniculocortical and intra-V1 horizontal connections, and a far-surround generated exclusively by interareal feedback. Using stimuli confined to the near- or far-surround of V1 neurons, and similar stimuli in human psychophysics, we find that near-surround suppression is more sharply orientation tuned than far-surround suppression in both macaque V1 and human perception. These results point to a similarity between surround suppression in macaque V1 and human vision, and suggest that feedback circuits are less orientation biased than horizontal circuits. We find the sharpest tuning of near-surround suppression in V1 layers (3, 4B, 4C$\alpha$) with patterned and orientation-specific horizontal connections. Sharpest tuning of far-surround suppression occurs in layer 4B, suggesting greater orientation specificity of feedback to this layer. Different orientation tuning of near- and far-surround suppression may reflect a statistical bias in natural images, whereby nearby edges have higher probability than distant edges of being co-oriented and belonging to the same contour. Surround suppression would, thus, increase the coding efficiency of frequently co-occurring contours and the saliency of less frequent ones. Such saliency increase can help detect small orientation differences in nearby edges (for contour completion), but large orientation differences in distant edges (for directing saccades/attention).},

We show here that the extraclassical surrounds that underlie these effects are present in magnocellular-pathway (MC) but not in parvocellular-pathway (PC) retinal ganglion cells of the macaque. The response of MC cells to drifting gratings and flashing spots was halved by drifting or contrast-reversing gratings surrounding their receptive fields, but PC cell responses were unaffected. The suppression cannot have arisen from the classical receptive field, or been caused by scattered light, because it could be evoked by annuli that themselves caused little or no response from the cell, and is consistent with the action of a divisive suppressive mechanism. Suppression in MC cells was broadly tuned for spatial and temporal frequency and greater at high contrast. If perceptual phenomena with similar stimulus contexts, such as the "shift effect" and saccadic suppression, have a retinal component, then they reflect the activity of the MC pathway.},

abstract = {www.sciencemag.org (this infomation is current as of The following resources related to this article are available online at Theoretical studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing. Although area V1 has been studied for over 40 years, little is known about how V1 en-codes complex natural scenes. Theoretical stud-ies suggest that natural scenes can be efficient-ly represented by a sparse code based on filters that resemble neurons found in area V1 (1, 2). Sparse codes lie along a continuum ranging from dense codes, where neurons respond to most stimuli, to local codes, where neurons give extremely selective responses (3). Both of these extremes are inefficient in several important respects. Dense codes are highly redundant and each neural response carries little information, whereas local codes require an implausibly large number of neu-rons and are computationally intractable. In contrast, neurons that are tuned to match the sparsely distributed, informative components of the natural world can produce sparse codes. Sparse codes transmit information with min-imal redundancy and relatively few spikes.},

abstract = {Mice are primarily nocturnal animals that rely on their whiskers to navigate dark underground burrows and winding corridors. When a whisker touches an object, cells called neurons at the base of the whiskers produce electrical signals that are relayed to other neurons in an area of the brain called the barrel cortex. However, it is not clear how information is encoded in these electrical signals, in part, because it is technically challenging to collect data about neuron activity and behavior while the mice move around. To overcome these difficulties, Sofroniew, Vlasov et al. used a touch-based (or 'tactile') virtual reality system to study how mice navigate along corridors. The system simulated the contact the whiskers would have with the walls of a winding corridor. This was achieved by moving the walls with motors while holding the mouse still enough to be able to measure the activity of neurons in the barrel cortex and observe the behavior of the animal. The experiments show that the electrical signals in the barrel cortex encode information about motion as well as the distance between the mouse and the wall. For example, some neurons in the barrel cortex were only activated when a mouse was a particular distance from the walls. The experiments suggest that the barrel cortex processes signals received from several whiskers to build an overall picture of the locations and shapes of objects. Sofroniew, Vlasov et al. also used a technique called optogenetics to deliberately activate particular neurons in a manner that mimics their activity patterns during interactions with walls. In the absence of walls, the optogenetic stimuli guided the behavior of the mice so that they tracked along the paths of 'illusory' corridors. Together, these findings reveal the neural code in the barrel cortex that allows mice to navigate by touch.},

abstract = {In the course of studies to map spatial frequency tuning of neurons in layers 2 and 3 of macaque striate cortex, we found that a high proportion (70{\%}) of cells in the interblob regions responded poorly to full-field gratings, compared with responses to single bars, edges, or delimited gratings. This was most often due to side inhibition, in which increasing the number of cycles of a grating placed within the cell's receptive field causes progressive inhibition of response. Quantitative receptive-field mappings showed, however, that the inhibition can occur within the region activated by a bar, as well as beyond it. The inhibition appears to be orientation-selective, in that a surround grating was more effective at inhibiting the response to a center grating patch if it was of similar orientation. 2-Deoxyglucose experiments confirmed that side inhibition is very widespread in the interblobs of layers 2 and 3 and suggested that it is reduced or lacking in layers 4A through 6. Since layers 2 and 3 of striate cortex are the major source of cortical projections to area V2 and beyond, the prevalence of side stopping in these laminae has implications for theories of cortical visual function. Side-stopped interblob cells may be acting as "contour-pass filters" that filter out redundant information in textured or noisy surfaces, focusing subsequent form processing on contrasts corresponding to object boundaries.},

abstract = {Horizontal connections, formed primarily by the axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, extend for millimeters parallel to the cortical surface and form patchy terminations. Previous studies have provided evidence that the patches formed by horizontal connections exhibit modular specificity, preferentially linking columns of neurons with similar response characteristics, such as preferred orientation. The issue of how these connections are distributed with respect to the topographic map of visual space, however, has not been resolved. Here we combine optical imaging of intrinsic signals with small extracellular injections of biocytin to assess quantitatively the specificity of horizontal connections with respect to both the map of orientation preference and the map of visual space in tree shrew V1. Our results indicate that horizontal connections outside a radius of 500 microm from the injection site exhibit not only modular specificity, but also specificity for axis of projection. Labeled axons extend for longer distances, and give off more terminal boutons, along an axis in the map of visual space that corresponds to the preferred orientation of the injection site. Inside of 500 microm, the pattern of connections is much less specific, with boutons found along every axis, contacting sites with a wide range of preferred orientations. The system of long-range horizontal connections can be summarized as preferentially linking neurons with co-oriented, co-axially aligned receptive fields. These observations suggest specific ways that horizontal circuits contribute to the response properties of layer 2/3 neurons and to mechanisms of visual perception.},

abstract = {A fundamental feature of neural circuitry in the primary visual cortex (V1) is the existence of recurrent excitatory connections between spiny neurons, recurrent inhibitory connections between smooth neurons, and local connections between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We modeled the dynamic behavior of intermixed excitatory and inhibitory populations of cells in V1 that receive input from the classical receptive field (the receptive field center) through feedforward thalamocortical afferents, as well as input from outside the classical receptive field (the receptive field surround) via long-range intracortical connections. A counterintuitive result is that the response of oriented cells can be facilitated beyond optimal levels when the surround stimulus is cross-oriented with respect to the center and suppressed when the surround stimulus is iso-oriented. This effect is primarily due to changes in recurrent inhibition within a local circuit. Cross-oriented surround stimulation leads to a reduction of presynaptic inhibition and a supraoptimal response, whereas iso-oriented surround stimulation has the opposite effect. This mechanism is used to explain the orientation and contrast dependence of contextual interactions in primary visual cortex: responses to a center stimulus can be both strongly suppressed and supraoptimally facilitated as a function of surround orientation, and these effects diminish as stimulus contrast decreases.},

abstract = {We have shown previously the existence of small, activity-dependent changes in intrinsic optical properties of cortex that are useful for optical imaging of cortical functional architecture. In this study we introduce a higher resolution optical imaging system that offers spatial and temporal resolution exceeding that achieved by most alternative imaging techniques for imaging cortical functional architecture or for monitoring local changes in cerebral blood volume or oxygen saturation. In addition, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for the activity-dependent intrinsic signals evoked by sensory stimuli, and studied their origins and wavelength dependence. These studies enabled high-resolution visualization of cortical functional architecture at wavelengths ranging from 480 to 940 nm. With the use of near-infrared illumination it was possible to image cortical functional architecture through the intact dura or even through a thinned skull. In addition, the same imaging technique proved useful for imaging and discriminating sensory-evoked, activity-dependent changes in local blood volume and oxygen saturation (oxygen delivery). Illumination at 570 nm allowed imaging of activity-dependent blood volume increases, whereas at 600-630 nm, the predominant signal probably originated from activity-dependent oxygen delivery from capillaries. The onset of oxygen delivery started prior to the blood volume increase. Thus, optical imaging based on intrinsic signals is a minimally invasive procedure for monitoring short- and long-term changes in cerebral activity.},

Using electrical stimulation, we compared the conduction velocities along feedforward and feedback axons between areas V1 and V2 of the macaque monkey.

We examined the effects of attention on the receptive fields of simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) by training macaque monkeys to perform a task with two modes. In the attended mode, the stimuli relevant to the animal's task overlay the receptive field of the neuron being recorded. In the unattended mode, the animal was cued to attend to stimuli outside the receptive field of that neuron. The relevant stimulus, a colored pixel, was briefly presented within a white-noise stimulus, a flickering grid of black and white pixels. The receptive fields of the neurons were mapped by correlating spikes with the white-noise stimulus in both attended and unattended modes. We found that attention could cause significant modulation of the visually evoked response despite an absence of significant effects on the overall firing rates. On further examination of the relationship between the strength of the visual stimulation and the firing rate, we found that attention appears to cause multiplicative scaling of the visually evoked responses of simple cells, demonstrating that attention reaches back to the initial stages of visual cortical processing.},

abstract = {Attention typically amplifies neuronal responses evoked by task-relevant stimuli while attenuating responses to task-irrelevant distracters. In this context, visual distracters constitute an external source of noise that is diminished to improve attended signal quality. Activity that is internal to the cortex itself, stimulus-independent ongoing correlated fluctuations in firing, might also act as task-irrelevant noise. To examine this, we recorded from area V4 of macaques performing an attention-demanding task. The firing of neurons to identically repeated stimuli was highly variable. Much of this variability originates from ongoing low-frequency ({\textless}5 Hz) fluctuations in rate correlated across the neuronal population. When attention is directed to a stimulus inside a neuron's receptive field, these correlated fluctuations in rate are reduced. This attention-dependent reduction of ongoing cortical activity improves the signal-to-noise ratio of pooled neural signals substantially more than attention-dependent increases in firing rate. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Feedback has been implicated in attention, expectation, and sensory context, but the mechanisms underlying these diverse feedback functions are unknown. Using specific optogenetic inactivation of feedback connections from the secondary visual area (V2), we show how feedback affects neural responses in the primate primary visual cortex (V1). Reducing feedback activity increases V1 cells' receptive field (RF) size, decreases their responses to stimuli confined to the RF, and increases their responses to stimuli extending into the proximal surround, therefore reducing surround suppression. Moreover, stronger reduction of V2 feedback activity leads to progressive increase in RF size and decrease in response amplitude, an effect predicted by a recurrent network model. Our results indicate that feedback modulates RF size, surround suppression and response amplitude, similar to the modulatory effects of visual spatial attention.},

At the neuronal level, noise exclusion might result in altered spatial integration properties. We tested this proposal by recording neuronal activity and length tuning in neurons of the primary visual cortex of the macaque when attention was directed toward or away from stimuli presented in each neuron's classical receptive field. For cells with central-parafoveal receptive fields, attention reduced spatial integration, as demonstrated by a reduction in preferred stimulus length and in the size of the spatial summation area. Conversely, in cells that represented more peripheral locations, attention increased spatial integration by increasing the cell's summation area. This previously unknown dichotomy between central and peripheral vision could support accurate analysis of attended foveal objects and target selection for impending eye movements to peripheral objects.},

abstract = {Neuronal responses in primary visual cortex (V1) to optimally oriented high-contrast stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed by stimuli in the RF surround, but can be facilitated when the RF center is stimulated at low contrast. The neural circuits and mechanisms for surround modulation are still unknown. We previously proposed that topdown feedback connections mediate suppression from the "far" surround, while "near' surround suppression is mediated primarily by horizontal connections. We implemented this idea in a recurrent network model of V1. A model assumption needed to account for the contrast-dependent sign of surround modulation is a response asymmetry between excitation and inhibition; accordingly, inhibition, but not excitation, is silent for weak visual inputs to the RF center, and surround stimulation can evoke facilitation. A prediction stemming from this same assumption is that surround suppression is weaker for low than for high contrast stimuli in the RF center. Previous studies are inconsistent with this prediction. Using single unit recordings in macaque V1, we confirm this model's prediction. Model simulations demonstrate that our results can be reconciled with those from previous studies. We also performed a systematic comparison of the experimentally measured surround suppression strength with predictions of the model operated in different parameter regimes. We find that the original model, with strong horizontal and no feedback excitation of local inhibitory neurons, can only partially account quantitatively for the experimentally measured suppression. Strong direct feedback excitation of V1 inhibitory neurons is necessary to account for the experimentally measured surround suppression strength. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The anatomy that underlies retinotopy and ocular dominance is well known, but no anatomical structure related to orientation selectivity has been found in primates. We examined whether the arrangement of local axon systems projecting within the cortical layers might be correlated with orientation preference in New World monkeys. We found that axons in layer 3 spread out from the site of a tracer injection in an anisotropic manner and that this elongated distribution is aligned with the preferred orientation recorded at each site. Moreover, within a few degrees of the foveal representation, the majority of the axon terminals fall within or just outside of the limits of the cortical mapping of the classical receptive field. Thus local axons produce a field of monosynaptic excitation that aligns with orientation axes and reaches neurons that have receptive fields which are adjacent in visual space.},
