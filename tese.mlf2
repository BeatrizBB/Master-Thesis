In this example, we consider direction selectivity tuning as the criteria for the feedback wiring. \newline \textbf {Top:} A stimulus (the cat) moving in a given direction (left to right) will activate neurons in V1 with that direction selectivity and with their receptive fields located at the corresponding region where the stimulus is in the subject's visual field at that time $t_0$ (left-side, blue labeled azimuth angle). \newline \textbf {Middle:} These DS left field-of-view corresponding neurons feedforward to neurons whose RF represents the same left-side location in the visual field. These would project back into V1 neurons corresponding to positions on the middle region (green-labeled azimuth angle) activated by the stimulus at $t_1$. \newline \textbf {Down: } These neurons, activated by the stimuli presentation in that visual field region, also connect retinotopically to LM cells with the same direction selectivity. Again, these project to the neurons corresponding to the RF position ahead (right-side, red-labeled azimuth angle), activated by the stimulus at $t_2$). \newline In this way, predictions on the next cat's position, as assumed by the direction it followed at previous times, could be relayed via feedback from LM to V1 neurons. \newline \newline \relax \fontsize {5}{6}\selectfont {Image from the presentation by one of the principal co-authors of \cite {Tiago}, Tiago Marques, under the Champalimaud Internal Seminar Series on October $15^{th}$ 2017, \textit {The functional organization of cortical feedback}.}\relax }}{\reset@font\mlffont 12}{figure.caption.8}}
