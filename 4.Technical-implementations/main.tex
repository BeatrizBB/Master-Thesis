\textit{As the first part of this thesis' work development, I implemented and coded the hardware adaptations and software protocols for the real-time behavioral control and stimulus presentation to be used in the experiments with the open-source arduino-based system Bpod, by adapting the previously used microkernel-based system Bcontrol. This implied the ensurement of a syncronized graphical user interface, the comunication between a governing machine, a microscopy apparatus, a stimuli monitor and a bpod device, within minimal processing time, as well as different states matrices and protocols for each stimulation type - RF mapping, tuning mapping and SM properties investigation.
Moreover, the system also required proper functionality within the software controling the two-photon microscope, which was enabled by proper understanding of the trigger and configuration requirements of the software ScanImage.}
