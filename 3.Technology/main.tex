\textit{Developing precise and reliable tools for the spatial and temporal mapping of neuronal activity is crucial to understand the functional architecture of the brain. Radiotracer, electrophisiological, magnetic resonance, anatomic and optical imaging techniques all offer advantages and disadvantages to this end [REFERENCES]. On its part, optical imaging of neuronal activity allows the mapping of large regions of the cortex, varying in time as responses to stimuli. This can be acomplished with voltage sensitive dyes [REFERENCES], changes in the optical properties of the tissue or with the aid of genetic tools. In here, we review the utilized techniques: Intrinsic optical signal imaging that draws on the changing reflectance in the hemodynamics of the cortex and two-photon laser microscopy that takes advantage of genetic manipulation tools.}
