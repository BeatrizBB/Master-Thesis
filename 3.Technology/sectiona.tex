\subsection{Acquiring functional maps of neuronal activity}

Neuronal activity can comprise the generation and propagation of action potentials, postsynaptic ion fluxes and potentials, neurotransmission, synaptic vesicle recycling, among other processes allocating cerebral cortex energy, along with the maintenance of glial and neuronal resting potentials. Furthermore, the cortex presents activity evoked by sensory stimuli or motor processes, but cortical populations of neurons also show spontaneous coordinated patterns of spiking activity, non-related to any sensory input or motor output.

In regards to the evoked activity, investigating the organizational and functional architecture of the sensory brain requires the means to both detect neuronal activity and to relate these responses to the external stimuli that the subject receives.  

 
% INTRODUCTION This patterns appear in slow-wave sleep, anesthesia and quiet wakefulness[REFERENCES], and the observed patterns are thought to be involved in internal processes, such as memory consolidation, mental imagery, behavioral variability or hallucinations [REFERENCES]. 

The classical approaches developed to this end study animal's brain's \textit{in vivo} by exploring electrophysiological principles: by placing electrodes inside the individual's scalp, one can extracellularly record single cells' electrical activity in a direct manner and access neuron's voltage fluctuations. Multi-unit recordings are also possible through this method. 

Other techniques include the 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) autoradiographic method [SOKOLOFF ET AL, 1977] to find and measure glucose consumption in the brain. These metabolic alterations are associated to changes in functional activity and thus an acumulation of the radiolabeled 2DG, representing the integrated rate of glucose consumption, marks the activity areas of the brain.

However, many experimental goals require extensive simultaneous recordings while these techniques require  long combersome experiments to cover large areas of the cortex. Moreover, electrophysiological mapping methods introduce considerable sampling bias in the recordings as well as poor spacial resolution ($~1 cm$), while 2-DG maps can only be analysed \textit{post-mortem}, allowing only one experimental session per animal, and can only label two stimulus at the maximum.

Imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) introduce less invasive means to simultaneously access larger regions of the brain while the subject is being presented to stimuli and also enable longitudal studies by repeated imaging sessions with the same individual animal. These methods are based on variations of optically measurable properties of physiological processes associated with neuronal activity.

NIRS....

Intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) enables the visualization of alterations in intrinsic optical properties of neuronal tissues, as a response to neuronal activity.

Slow reflectance light signals are intrinsicly relayed from the surface of the striate cortex due to hemodynamic responses[REFERENCES] that correlate with neuronal activity. Neuronal firing induces blood changes - neurovascular coupling - that produce a light reflectance change.

Neuronal activity requires the hydrolysis of ATP and the oxy-hemoglobin (the protein hemoglobin in red blood cells binded to oxygen) molecules in the capillaries provide the majority of the oxygen used to regenerate ATP via glucose metabolism. Thus, an active brain region is associated with a finely localized increase in oxygen demand and thus a local rise in deoxy-hemoglobin (deoxygenated hemoglobin) and a depletion in oxy-hemoglobin concentrations. This is followed by an hemodynamic response of locally increased blood flow in the capilaries and dilatation of the closeby arteries to replenish and sufice the oxygen requirements.

In this neuronally active situation, the hemodynamic response imposes a light reflectance variation, resulting from three major sources: the changes in blood volume, blood oxygenation and light scattering.

The blood volume component of the signal is the least spatially confined of the three factors, but can nevertheless yield alone functional maps, with the injection of fluorescence dyes into the bloodstream [REFERENCE].

The oxymetry signal is used for instance in fMRI techniques that identify the areas of the brain to which more oxygenated blood is being driven to, relying on how the magnetic properties of more and less oxygenated blood differ. A $1-2s$ delayed rise in oxygenation is associated to more active cells and brain usage. However, depending on the magnetic field intensity, this technique can have limited spatial resolution, as it relies on the transition phase that is also associated with the dilatation of arterioles adjoining the original activity sites which can cause signal artifacts.

On the other hand, light scattering changes (REFERENCES) allow for precise temporal and spatial functional mappings of neuronal activity. Higher neuronal activity increases light scattering due to factors like (REFERENCES COHEN 1973). This increase peaks within 2-3 s of the stimulus onset.

With these physiological events optical properties' changes, one can extract the optical signals that correlate with that variance and thus with neuronal activity. Since about $13\%$ of the energy consumption is used for maintenance of the resting state and the greater parcel of the cortical metabolized ATP costs are for action potential propagation (about $47\%$) [REFERENCES], with the remainder for processes related to synaptic transmission, the intrinsic signal has the major contribution from an oxymetry factor that relates to those inhibitory or subtreshold excitatory input processes.

\subsection{Intrinsic Signal Optical Imaging: the technique}

In the technique used in this work, ISOI, the signal brings about information on the oxy-hemoglobin concentrations during neuronal activity. For both anesthetized and awake animals, the typical ISOI signal follows a tri-phasic structure: An initial dip, a negative peak at about 4-6s after stimulus onset, and a large rebound [GET REFERENCES].[GET IMAGE] 

Illumination by a stable output source at the red wavelenght level of $540 nm$ optimally excites the oxygenated blood flow, while the de-oxygenated blood reflects less light at this wavelength [REFERENCES]. 

These differentiated properties enable the mapping of the most active, de-oxygenated brain areas at the time of the initial local deoxy-hemoglobin increase, since these regions will reflect less red light than the inactive, amply oxygenated cerebral areas.

ISOI utilizes this principle in brain areas which can be reached by light (around $500 \mu m$ maximum). In an animal with a window implantation and illumination of its primary cortex surface, one can record the brain area with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera to monitor the changes in the reflected light signal from each region of the primary cortex of the subject while this animal is presented to stimuli. In this way, one obtains maps that make correspond the stimulation that the subject receives - visual, somatosensory, auditory [REFERENCES]- to the observed refleted light signal profile at that time interval and in that brain region, whitin some relatively high temporal ($80 ms$) and spatial resolutions (in the order of $100 \mu m$) [REFERENCES].

The properties of this signal in amplitude and temporal dynamics, as well as of their components, depend on both the stimuli and on the wavelength of the ilumination light that the brain is receiving[REFERENCES].


The signals' information is extracted by calculating differences between unstimulated baselines and post stimulation time points. For each stimulus, multiple repeatitions are held and the respective signals averaged across the same time points.


Furthermore, in regards to the stimuli dependence of the signal's timecourse, the ISOI signal can be divided into a global stimulus-non-specific response and a local stimulus-specific response that is observed from functionally organized cortical columns[REFERENCE]. This latter component stands as the actual mapping signal. 

[REFERENCE] found that the signal's rise time and time to peak were nearly identical for both short and long stimulus durations. However, the  relaxation time course of the signal does depend on the stimuli duration, which imposes an appropriate inter-stimulus interval and/or aware analysis.
