\section{Visual stimulation}
\label{sec:Visual-stimulation}

For both the ISOI and visual stimuli protocols, an LED display (BenQ XL2411Z, 144-Hz monitor, stimulus presented at $60 Hz$) was used. The screen was placed at $15 cm$ from the mouse's right eye and  aligned at $30ยบ$ to the axis of its nose-line, insuring access to the visual space of $120ยบ$ in azimuth and $60ยบ$ in elevation???. The stimuli were produced and presented using
Matlab and the Psychophysics Toolbox [REFERENCES] (chapter 3,??).
