The high intracellular GECI concentrations required for in vivo imaging are usually achieved by viral gene transfer using adeno-associated viruses. Transgenic expression of GECIs promises important advantages, including homogeneous, repeatable, and stable expression without the need for invasive virus injections. Here we present the generation and characterization of transgenic mice expressing the GECIs GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f under the Thy1 promoter. We quantified GCaMP6 expression across brain regions and neurons and compared to other transgenic mice and AAV-mediated expression. We tested three mouse lines for imaging in the visual cortex in vivo and compared their performance to mice injected with AAV expressing GCaMP6. Furthermore, we show that GCaMP6 Thy1 transgenic mice are useful for long-term, high-sensitivity imaging in behaving mice.},

abstract = {The combination of two-photon microscopy recordings and powerful calcium-dependent fluorescent sensors enables simultaneous recording of unprecedentedly large populations of neurons. While these sensors have matured over several generations of development, computational methods to process their fluorescence remain inefficient and the results hard to interpret. Here, we introduce a set of practical methods based on novel clustering algorithms, and provide a complete pipeline from raw image data to neuronal calcium traces to inferred spike times. We formulate a generative model of the fluorescence image, incorporating spike times and a spatially smooth neuropil signal, and solve the inference and learning problems using a fast algorithm. This implementation scales linearly with the number of recorded cells, and the complete pipeline runs in approximately one hour for typical two-hour long recordings, on commodity GPUs. Furthermore, this method recovers twice as many cells as a previous standard method. This allowed us to routinely record and detect ∼10,000 cells simultaneously from the visual cortex of awake mice using standard two-photon resonant-scanning microscopes. The software is publicly available at github.com/cortex-lab/Suite2P, together with a graphical user interface that allows rapid manual curation of the results.},

The spatial scales of interest to the neurobiologist range from individual synapses (∼1 $\mu$m) to neural circuits (centimeters); the timescales range from the flickering of channels (less than a millisecond) to long-term memory (years). Remarkably, fluorescence microscopy has the potential to revolutionize research on all of these spatial and temporal scales. Two-photon excitation (2PE) laser scanning microscopy allows high-resolution and high-sensitivity fluorescence microscopy in intact neural tissue, which is hostile to traditional forms of microscopy. Over the last 10 years, applications of 2PE, including microscopy and photostimulation, have contributed to our understanding of a broad array of neurobiological phenomena, including the dynamics of single channels in individual synapses and the functional organization of cortical maps.

abstract = {In macaque primary visual cortex (V1) neuronal responses to stimuli inside the receptive field (RF) are modulated by stimuli in the RF surround. This modulation is orientation-specific. Previous studies suggested that for some cells this specificity may not be fixed, but changes with the stimulus orientation presented to the RF. We demonstrate, in recording studies, that this tuning behavior is instead highly prevalent in V1 and, in theoretical work, that it arises only if V1 operates in a regime of strong local recurrence. Strongest surround suppression occurs when the stimuli in the RF and the surround are iso-oriented, and strongest facilitation when the stimuli are cross-oriented. This is the case even when the RF is sub-optimally activated by a stimulus of non- preferred orientation, but only if this stimulus can activate the cell when presented alone. This tuning behavior emerges from the interaction of lateral inhibition (via the surround pathways), which is tuned to the RF's preferred orientation, with weakly-tuned, but strong, local recurrent connections, causing maximal withdrawal of recurrent excitation at the feedforward input orientation. Thus, horizontal and feedback modulation of strong recurrent circuits allows the tuning of contextual effects to change with changing feedforward inputs.},

abstract = {The responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) to stimulation of their receptive field (RF) are modulated by stimuli in the RF surround. This modulation is suppressive when the stimuli in the RF and surround are of similar orientation, but less suppressive or facilitatory when they are cross-oriented. Similarly, in human vision surround stimuli selectively suppress the perceived contrast of a central stimulus. Although the properties of surround modulation have been thoroughly characterized in many species, cortical areas and sensory modalities, its role in perception remains unknown. Here we argue that surround modulation in V1 consists of multiple components having different spatio-temporal and tuning properties, generated by different neural circuits and serving different visual functions. One component arises from LGN afferents, is fast, untuned for orientation, and spatially restricted to the surround region nearest to the RF (the near-surround); its function is to normalize V1 cell responses to local contrast. Intra-V1 horizontal connections contribute a slower, narrowly orientation-tuned component to near-surround modulation, whose function is to increase the coding efficiency of natural images in manner that leads to the extraction of object boundaries. The third component is generated by topdown feedback connections to V1, is fast, broadly orientation-tuned, and extends into the far-surround; its function is to enhance the salience of behaviorally relevant visual features. Far- and near-surround modulation, thus, act as parallel mechanisms: the former quickly detects and guides saccades/attention to salient visual scene locations, the latter segments object boundaries in the scene.},

In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5-40-µm long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

abstract = {The technique for autoradiographic localization of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) uptake has become a useful method for observing alterations of functional brain activity resulting from experimental manipulation. Autoradiographic resolution is improved using tritiated ([3H]) rather than carbon-14 ([14C)]2DG, due to the lower energy and shorter path of tritium emissions. In addition, lower 2DG uptake by white matter relative to gray matter is exaggerated in the [3H]2DG autoradiographs due to the greater absorption of tritium emissions by lipids. Using [3H]2DG, it is possible to observe differential metabolic labeling in various individual nuclei or portions of nuclei that is unresolvable using [14C]2DG in the awake, normal animal. Heterogeneous patterns of 2DG uptake seen only with [3H]2DG are found in the nucleus accumbens, the anterior portion of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, specific nuclei of the inferior olivary complex, various hypothalamic regions, and a region straddling the border of the medial and lateral habenular nuclei. The lamination of differential 2DG uptake in the hippocampus is better localized using [3H]2DG. Autoradiographic resolution of labeled 2DG is further improved when the brain is perfused prior to frozen sectioning, due perhaps to selective fixation and retention of intracellular labeled 2-deoxy-glycogen. A series of [3H]2DG autoradiographs are presented together with views of the Nissl-stained sections that produced the autoradiographs.},

abstract = {Neuronal responses in primary visual cortex (V1) to optimally oriented high-contrast stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed by stimuli in the RF surround, but can be facilitated when the RF center is stimulated at low contrast. The neural circuits and mechanisms for surround modulation are still unknown. We previously proposed that topdown feedback connections mediate suppression from the “far” surround, while “near” surround suppression is mediated primarily by horizontal connections. We implemented this idea in a recurrent network model of V1. A model assumption needed to account for the contrast-dependent sign of surround modulation is a response asymmetry between excitation and inhibition; accordingly, inhibition, but not excitation, is silent for weak visual inputs to the RF center, and surround stimulation can evoke facilitation. A prediction stemming from this same assumption is that surround suppression is weaker for low than for high contrast stimuli in the RF center. Previous studies are inconsistent with this prediction. Using single unit recordings in macaque V1, we confirm this model's prediction. Model simulations demonstrate that our results can be reconciled with those from previous studies. We also performed a systematic comparison of the experimentally-measured surround suppression strength with predictions of the model operated in different parameter regimes. We find that the original model, with strong horizontal and no feedback excitation of local inhibitory neurons, can only partially account quantitatively for the experimentally-measured suppression. Strong direct feedback excitation of V1 inhibitory neurons is necessary to account for the experimentally-measured surround suppression strength.},

One can map a relatively large region, obtain successive maps to different stimuli in the same cortical area and follow variations in response over time. In the intact mammalian brain this imaging has been accomplished with the aid of voltage sensitive dyes. However, it has been known for many years that some intrinsic changes in the optical properties of the tissue are dependent on electrical or metabolic activity. Here we show that these changes can be used to study the functional architecture of cortex. Optical maps of whisker barrels in the rat and the orientation columns in the cat visual cortex, obtained by reflection measurements of the intrinsic signal, were confirmed with voltage sensitive dyes or by electrophysiological recordings. In addition, we describe an intrinsic signal originating from small arteries which can be used to investigate the communication between local neuronal activity and the microvasculature. One advantage of the method is that it is non-invasive and does not require dyes, a clear benefit for clinical applications.},

abstract = {In primary visual cortex (V1) neuronal responses to stimuli inside the receptive field (RF) are usually suppressed by stimuli in the RF surround. This suppression is orientation-specific. Similarly, in human vision surround stimuli can suppress perceived contrast of a central stimulus in an orientation-dependent manner. The surround consists of two regions likely generated by different circuits: a near-surround generated predominantly by geniculocortical and intra-V1 horizontal connections, and a far-surround generated exclusively by inter-areal feedback. Using stimuli confined to the near- or far-surround of V1 neurons, and similar stimuli in human psychophysics, we find that near-surround suppression is more sharply orientation-tuned than far- surround suppression in both macaque V1 and human perception. These results point to a similarity between surround suppression in macaque V1 and human vision, and suggest that feedback circuits are less orientation-biased than horizontal circuits. We find sharpest tuning of near-surround suppression in V1 layers (3, 4B, 4C$\alpha$) with patterned and orientation-specific horizontal connections. Sharpest tuning of far-surround suppression occurs in layer 4B, suggesting greater orientation-specificity of feedback to this layer. Different orientation-tuning of near and far surround suppression may reflect a statistical bias in natural images, whereby nearby edges have higher probability than distant edges of being co-oriented and belonging to the same contour. Surround suppression would, thus, increase the coding efficiency of frequently co-occurring contours and the saliency of less frequent ones. Such saliency increase can help detect small orientation differences in nearby edges (for contour completion), but large orientation differences in distant edges (for directing saccades/attention).},

%abstract = {Visual motion is an ethologically important stimulus throughout the animal kingdom. In primates, motion perception relies on specific higher-order cortical regions. Although mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and higher-order visual areas show direction-selective (DS) responses, their role in motion perception remains unknown. Here, we tested whether V1 is involved in motion perception in mice. We developed a head-fixed discrimination task in which mice must report their perceived direction of motion from random dot kinematograms (RDKs). After training, mice made around 90{\%} correct choices for stimuli with high coherence and performed significantly above chance for 16{\%} coherent RDKs. Accuracy increased with both stimulus duration and visual field coverage of the stimulus, suggesting that mice in this task integrate motion information in time and space. Retinal recordings showed that thalamically projecting On-Off DS ganglion cells display DS responses when stimulated with RDKs. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed that neurons in layer (L) 2/3 of V1 display strong DS tuning in response to this stimulus. Thus, RDKs engage motion-sensitive retinal circuits as well as downstream visual cortical areas. Contralateral V1 activity played a key role in this motion direction discrimination task because its reversible inactivation with muscimol led to a significant reduction in performance. Neurometric-psychometric comparisons showed that an ideal observer could solve the task with the information encoded in DS L2/3 neurons. Motion discrimination of RDKs presents a powerful behavioral tool for dissecting the role of retino-forebrain circuits in motion processing. Using a head-fixed task, Marques et al. show that mice can discriminate the direction of motion of random dot kinetogram stimuli (RDK). RDKs elicit direction-selective responses in both On-Off DSGCs of the retina and in V1 L2/3 neurons. V1 inactivation impairs task performance, showing that this area plays a key role in motion perception.},

In this study, we have used intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI), a relatively high spatial resolution imaging technique, to examine the temporal resolution of the hemodynamic signal. We imaged V1 responses in anesthetized monkey to a moving light spot. Movies of cortical responses clearly revealed a focus of hemodynamic response traveling across the cortical surface. Importantly, at different locations along the cortical trajectory, response timecourses maintained a similar tri-phasic shape and shifted sequentially across cortex with a predictable delay. We calculated the time between distinguishable timecourses and found that the temporal resolution of the signal at which two events can be reliably distinguished is about 80 milliseconds. These results suggest that hemodynamic-based imaging is suitable for detecting ongoing cortical events at high spatial resolution and with temporal resolution relevant for behavioral studies.},

Spontaneous and evoked patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, with densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. However, the propagation of spontaneous and evoked activity differed, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. The similarity of sparseness patterns for both neural events and distinct spread of activity may reflect similarity of local processing and differences in the flow of information through cortical circuits, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The responses ofneurons in sensory cortices are affected by the spatial context within which stimuli are embedded. In the primary visual cortex (V1), orientation-selective responses to stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed bysimilarly oriented stimuli in the RF surround. Surround suppression, a likely neural correlate of perceptual figure–ground segregation, is traditionally thought to be generated within V1 by long-range horizontal connections. Recently however, it has been shown that these connections are too short and too slow to mediate fast suppression from distant regions ofthe RF surround. We use an anatomically and physiologically constrained recurrent networkmodel ofmacaqueV1 to showhow interareal feedback connections, which are faster and longer-range than horizontal connections, can generate “far” surround suppression. We provide a novel solution to the puzzle ofhow surround suppression can arise from excitatory feedback axons contacting predominantly excitatory neurons in V1. The basic mechanism involves divergent feedback connections from the far surround targeting pyramidal neurons sending monosynaptic horizontal connections to excitatory and inhib- itory neurons in the RF center. One ofseveral predictions ofour model is that the “suppressive far surround” is not always suppressive, but can facilitate the response ofthe RF center, depending on the amount ofexcitatory drive to the local inhibitors. Our model provides a general mechanism of how top-down feedback signals directly contribute to generating cortical neuron responses to simple sensory stimuli.},

abstract = {Since optical imaging (OI) of intrinsic signals was first developed in the 1980s, significant advances have been made regarding our understanding of the origins of the recorded signals. The technique has been refined and the range of its applications has been broadened considerably. Here we review recent developments in methodology and data analysis as well as the latest findings on how intrinsic signals are related to metabolic cost and electrophysiological activity in the brain. We give an overview of what optical imaging has contributed to our knowledge of the functional architecture of sensory cortices, their development and plasticity. Finally, we discuss the utility of OI for functional studies of the human brain as well as in animal models of neuropathology. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Angelucci2017,
abstract = {Surround modulation (SM) is a fundamental property of sensory neurons in many species and sensory modalities. SM is the ability of stimuli in the surround of a neuron's receptive field (RF) to modulate (typically suppress) the neuron's response to stimuli simultaneously presented inside the RF, a property thought to underlie optimal coding of sensory information and im-portant perceptual functions. Understanding the circuit and mechanisms for SM can reveal fundamental principles of computations in sensory cortices, from mouse to human. Current debate is centered over whether feedfor-ward or intracortical circuits generate SM, and whether this results from increased inhibition or reduced excitation. Here we present a working hy-pothesis, based on theoretical and experimental evidence, that SM results from feedforward, horizontal, and feedback interactions with local recurrent connections, via synaptic mechanisms involving both increased inhibition and reduced recurrent excitation. In particular, strong and balanced recur-rent excitatory and inhibitory circuits play a crucial role in the computation of SM.},

@article{Coen-Cagli2012,
abstract = {Spatial context in images induces perceptual phenomena associated with salience and modulates the responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). However, the computational and ecological principles underlying contextual effects are incompletely understood. We introduce a model of natural images that includes grouping and segmentation of neighboring features based on their joint statistics, and we interpret the firing rates of V1 neurons as performing optimal recognition in this model. We show that this leads to a substantial generalization of divisive normalization, a computation that is ubiquitous in many neural areas and systems. A main novelty in our model is that the influence of the context on a target stimulus is determined by their degree of statistical dependence. We optimized the parameters of the model on natural image patches, and then simulated neural and perceptual responses on stimuli used in classical experiments. The model reproduces some rich and complex response patterns observed in V1, such as the contrast dependence, orientation tuning and spatial asymmetry of surround suppression, while also allowing for surround facilitation under conditions of weak stimulation. It also mimics the perceptual salience produced by simple displays, and leads to readily testable predictions. Our results provide a principled account of orientation-based contextual modulation in early vision and its sensitivity to the homogeneity and spatial arrangement of inputs, and lends statistical support to the theory that V1 computes visual salience.},
